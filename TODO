should be able to embed the example.

the preview will then run within an iframe.

most will just append itself to the body.

examples are just published to gh-pages, so that's what can be included.

the repo itself explains itself, the article itself is the readme?

I want the bare chix-ui to always be shown also.
The Iframe just runs, that's not the problem.
The Iframe is also precompiled, it does not load anything dynamic.

If the iframe is included that way, it's not the same origin.

The example itself should already include the bare chix-ui.
